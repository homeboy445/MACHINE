# SQL MACHINE
### The place to resolve your SQL queries and worriesðŸ˜‰.
---
## Description
### This is a demo SQL editor which can be used to query data easily from a given table(only one pre-existing table is there) and display it's result(only few SQL queries are working since it's a demo).

## Features
* The whole SQL experience has been abstracted in the form of a session. Session exists to manage the overall state of the app easily.
* SQL queries can easily be run via the query cell, like so...
* The results of the SQL queries can be downloaded easily for reference in the form of CSV or in the form of JSON.
* The results can also be shared easily via the share link.
* The total database schema can be viewed easily by the DB Info box, like so...

### NOTE: Since, there's no backend support currently to this app, the session will automatically expire once the user goes back to home or exits the app.

## Page Load Time(the values provided are approximated)
* The page load time of the home page is coming out to be - 2160ms(on first open) & 1148ms(after first open).
* The page load time of the editor page is coming out to be - 879ms(on first open) &  876ms(after first open).
